# Ray Tracing In One Weekend

This is a small ray tracer project that I started to learn more about how ray tracing works. The project is based on the book series "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley. The book series is available for free online at [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/).
